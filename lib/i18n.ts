        "声浪中文基于一个简单的理念：中文不仅是一门需要学习的语言，更是一场需要体验的旅程。我们的logo源自甲骨文中的“中”字——一面被风吹起的旗帜，线条如波浪般流动。它反映了我们的信念：语言流动、连接，并承载着人们跨越文化。",
      approach: "我们的方法",
      approachContent:
        "我们不把中文当作一门学科，而是将其视为一种体验——需要去感受、使用和生活的东西。我们的一对一线上和线下课程提供个性化指导，而小班课程则建立互动和信心。季节性营地、文化工坊和城市旅行让学习者通过故事、传统和真实的相遇来探索中文。从练习声调到分享茶香，或是发现一条新街道，声浪中文将学习变成了一段生动的旅程——有节奏、沉浸式、充满人性。",

Our logo draws from the oracle-bone form of “中”—a flag lifted by the wind, its lines flowing like waves. It reflects our belief that language moves, connects, and carries people across cultures.",

        "Instead of treating Mandarin as a subject, we approach it as an experience—something to feel, use, and live. Our one-on-one online and offline lessons provide personalized guidance, while small-group classes build interaction and confidence. Seasonal camps, cultural workshops, and city tours let learners explore Mandarin through stories, traditions, and real-life encounters. From practicing tones to sharing tea or discovering a new street, Mandarin Wave turns learning into a living journey—rhythmic, immersive, and human.",
